Description: # Abseil Python Common Libraries
        
        This repository is a collection of Python library code for building Python
        applications. The code is collected from Google's own Python code base, and has
        been extensively tested and used in production.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Simple application startup
        * Distributed commandline flags system
        * Custom logging module with additional features
        * Testing utilities
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Installation
        
        To install the package, simply run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install absl-py
        ```
        
        Or install from source:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Running Tests
        
        To run Abseil tests, you can clone the git repo and run
        [bazel](https://bazel.build/):
        
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:abseil/abseil-py.git
        cd abseil-py
        bazel test absl/...
        ```
        
        ### Example Code
        
        Please refer to [smoke_tests/sample_app.py](smoke_tests/sample_app.py) as an
        example to get started.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Full documentation is forthcoming on https://abseil.io. For now, please refer
        to the in-code Python docstrings.
        
        ## Future Releases
        
        The current repository includes an initial set of libraries for early adoption.
        More components and interoperability with Abseil C++ Common Libraries
        will come in future releases.
